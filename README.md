Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This project will demonstrate the lessons I have learned for the past few weeks regarding variables and operators, data types & conditionals, function basics. Using all this to make a working script for rock, paper, and scissors.

Pseudocode:
Task 1:
Return randomly generated number from 1 to 99
Assign range for string values "rock", "paper", and "scissors"
  If values is between 1 to 33 then return string value "rock"
  If values is between 34 to 66 then return string value "paper"
  If values is between 67 to 99 then return string value "scissors"
