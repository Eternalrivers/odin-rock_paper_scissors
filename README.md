Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This project will demonstrate the lessons I have learned for the past few weeks regarding variables and operators, data types & conditionals, function basics. Using all this to make a working script for rock, paper, and scissors.

Pseudocode:
Task 1:
Return randomly generated number from 1 to 99
Assign range for string values "rock", "paper", and "scissors"
  If values is between 1 to 33 then return string value "rock"
  If values is between 34 to 66 then return string value "paper"
  If values is between 67 to 99 then return string value "scissors"

Task 2:
Obtain a user input
Return a valid choice depending on the user's input
  If user enter's "rock", return "rock"
  If user enter's "paper", return "paper"
  If user enter's "scissors", return "scissor"
  Else return "NIL"

Task 3:
Initialize two counter variable for human score and computer score
Set both variable's value to zero
